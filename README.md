# backlink-checker
 Check your exchanged and bought backlinks, are they still online?
 I created a little tool to check that easily!
 
 ## Requirements
 `pip install requests`
 
 ## How to use it?
 You can either use the .exe file as a non-techie, or just simply use the Python file.
 
 You need to setup the `data.txt` file like in the example here.
